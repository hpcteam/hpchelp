Absolutely! I can create a **complete step-by-step guide in Markdown** (`.md`) format for you, documenting the **entire SSH & Git setup, cloning, remote fixing, and push process**. Here’s how it will look:

You can save this as `git_ssh_setup.md` or any name you like.

`

```

If you want, I can **also include all the terminal commands you ran, including cloning, setting remote, committing, and pushing**, so this becomes a **full step-by-step log** in the Markdown document.  

Do you want me to do that?
